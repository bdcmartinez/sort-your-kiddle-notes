We observed that while s-MoS2-NMP absorbs in the range of 300−400 nm (as reported in the literature40,43), s-NMP also displays a strong absorption in the same region.

, cyclohexane, which does not contain any heteroatoms. We observe that the ultrasonicated cyclohexane shows a diferent behavior. The blue emission from this sample is very weak (Figure 5d, left) in comparison with ultrasonicated butyronitrile. This behavior agrees reasonably well while comparing their fuorescence intensities at 370 nm excitation (Figure S11). From this analysis, it is clear that the emission intensity for sonicated butyronitrile or ethylene glycol (which contains heteroatoms) is higher than that for sonicated cyclohexane (which does not contain any heteroatom). It indicates that the existence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen in the starting solvent leads to brighter fuorescence in their corresponding sonicated samples.

remained unacknowledged in the design of experiments, which require ultrasonication of layered materials in organic solvents. This fnding has an important implication for liquid-phase exfoliation because these solvents are conventionally used in the ultrasonication-mediated synthesis of 2D nanostructures (e.g. , titanium disulfde,37 black phosphorus,38,39 molybdenum disulfde,40 tungsten disulfde,41 and carbon42). To demonstrate the relevance of our results, we exfoliated MoS2 in NMP following a protocol that is known to yield 2D MoS2 nanostructures (referred to as s-MoS2-NMP). 40,43 As a control to the above experiment, we also ultrasonicated NMP alone without any addition of MoS2 (referred to as s-NMP). We observe that both s-NMP and s-MoS2-NMP exhibit a similar brown-yellow color as well as similar blue luminescence under UV light (Figure 5e)

On the other hand, amorphous CNDs are mostly prepared by bottom-up synthetic strategies, and their core exhibits high carbonization degree without obvious crystal structure or polymer features. The edges of the amorphous carbon core domains often doped by heteroatoms are passivated by surface functional groups. Contrary to CQDs, the PL of CNDs is not dominated by the QCE of the particle size [46,47]. In addition, MFs as a remnant of the condensation phase of the synthesis can be covalently bound or non-covalently attached to both CQDs and amorphous CNDs

multicenter fuorophore structure and special PL mechanism [50– 52]. It should also be noted that the CPDs are distinguished from polymer dots (PDs), which lack the cross-linking of carbonized nanoparticles with polymer network structure [53]. CDs with welldefned homogeneous structures such as triangular CDs with narrow size distributions [54], crystalline C3N CDs [55], and chiral CDs [56–58] have also been reported.Importantly, composite materials containing CDs incorporated in polymers (e.g. , polyvinyl alcohol), metal-organic frameworks, or inorganic (e.g. , zeolites) host matrices exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and/or delayed fuorescence have been designed [45,59–63].1.4. Scope of the review Many excellent reviews have been written on synthesis, characterizations, PL mechanisms and applications of CDs [12,15,33,60,64–69]. Although some of them include also theoretical models [70], a comprehensive survey of quantum mechanics (QM) and/or molecular mechanics (MM) approaches and models applied in the feld of CDs is missing. In the current review, we (i) briefy summarize the experimental evidence on the structure and PL properties of individual classes of CDs referring the reader to more comprehensive reviews, (ii) describe state-of-the-art theoretical methods for description of absorption and fuorescence of CDs, (iii) provide an overview of theoretical studies addressing the structural models and electronic structure of CDs in the context of PL, and (iv) outline perspectives for future computational studies in the feld of CDs.2. Experimental data on structure and photoluminescence properties of CDs 2.1. Structural characterization of CDs A detailed structural information about systems of interest is a crucial aspect for any theoretical investigation. In this regard, CDs are indeed a challenging target not only because of inherent illdefned core and surface structures, but also due to a dependence of their fnal structure on the reaction conditions. In fact, different types of CDs can be synthesized from the same precursors depending on the ratio of reagents, temperature and pH [47,71]. In addition, as pointed out by Rogach and coworkers [72], potential ambiguities can occur in the structural characterisation of CDs when employing techniques commonly applied in other areas of the material science such as high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). For example, HR-XPS signals of substitutional nitrogen functionalities are usually presented as a proof of the nitrogen doping in CDs; however, the same signals can also be generated by molecular compounds such as 2

semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) of nanometer scale, the GQD edges infuence the electronic structure of the conjugated sp2 domain. Due to light atoms, GQDs have larger band gap than other similarly sized semiconducting inorganic QDs [34]. The band gap of the core states decreases with the increasing GQD size, and a red shift of the emission band occurs, up to the point where the effect of shape and edge dominates over GQD size [41]. Analysis of the concentration dependence of PL of small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) revealed that the band gap in GQDs can also be reduced by stacking effects that can lead to self-trapping of excitons and excimer formation in the PAH network [156].Also, efcient intersystem crossing (ISC) related to low 1ES-T values in the core states was observed, and thus the GQDs can exhibit TADF and phosphorescence [157]. The former results from a reversible S-T transition, in which the longliving triplet excitons (due to a spin-forbidden T1 → S0 transition and small 1ES-T) undergo the reverse ISC (RISC) leading to delayed fuorescence from the S1 state with lifetimes prolonged by few orders of magnitude compared to ordinary fuorescence. In the case of low-efcient RISC and provided that the triplet excitons are not deactivated non-radiatively, the spin-forbidden T1 → S0 transition accompanied with photon emission (phosphorescence) occurs on much slower timescales (typically microseconds). Apart from the intrinsic emission from the GQD core, surface states actively participate in the PL [78]. After excitation, intrinsic PL can be reduced by non-radiative decay into these surface states and a red shift in emission wavelengths can be observed 4

SÍNTESIS “VERDE” Y ESTUDIO DE LOS PROPIEDADES LUMINISCENTES DE LOS PUNTOS CUANTICOS DE GRAFENO Oxana Vasilievna Kharissova, Isauro Alejandro Treviño Pérez, Brayan Iván de la Cruz Martínez Facultad de Ciencias Físico Matemáticas, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León oxana.kharissova@uanl.edu.mx, isauro.trevinoprz@uanl.edu.mx, brayan.delacruz.mnz@uanl.edu.mx RESUMEN Los puntos cuánticos (QDs) tienen un alto coeficiente de conversión de luz y la luz que vuelven a emitir tiende a tener un espectro muy estrecho. Los físicos están atraídos principalmente por las características electrónicas del grafeno asociadas con la dispersión lineal de los portadores de carga. Hasta la fecha, el grafeno está considerado como uno de los principales candidatos para su aplicación como elemento de la nanoelectrónica del futuro. El interés en estas estructuras se debe principalmente a su pequeño tamaño y sus interesantes propiedades electrónicas, luminiscentes y mecánicas. El grafeno puro es de interés como membrana muy duradera o como sensor muy eficiente, mientras que puntos cuánticos de grafeno (GQD) con una superficie modificada se puede utilizar en la electrónica de semiconductores como base para diodos orgánicos, emisores de luz, biosensores y sensores químicos. Algunas de sus ventajas son su alta luminosidad, buena biocompatibilidad y su baja toxicidad, hasta día de hoy, el mecanismo real de luminosidad de objetos que contienen carbono nanoestructurado permanece abierto y discutible. Los métodos de producción de los puntos cuánticos de grafeno implican el uso de compuestos tóxicos, tales como: ácidos (HNO3, H2SO4), KMnO4, borohidruro de sodio, hidrato de hidracina y dimetilhidracina. El uso de métodos basados en ellos está asociado con riesgos para el medio ambiente y para la salud humana. El objetivo de esta investigación es la síntesis “verde” de puntos cuánticos de grafeno (GQD). Durante el experimento se aplicó ultrasonido por 12 horas a los precursores carbón negro y grafito con agentes reductoras (teraphthal y ácido ascórbico).

the results from TDDFT for the smaller particles. The used SEMO methods were found to estimate reasonably well the band gaps even for large and amorphous CNDs. 134135 Most likely many of these robust semiempirical schemes, initially considered compromises between speed and accuracy, will get a second life parametrizing them using machine learning (ML), the same way as molecular mechanical FF and EAIP for metals. 134 We have already seen this in parametrizing repulsive potentials density functional tight-binding. 135 2.1.5. Quantum Density Functional Theory (DFT). Among the quantum mechanical methods applied to the study of the optical properties of CDs, DFT methods are by far the most used. Compared to pure wave function theory methods such as HF, DFT methods has a greater capability of coupling reasonable accuracy with relatively low computational cost. DFT has the beneft to incorporate some of the correlation among electrons, with a much lower computational cost than correlated post HF wave function methods. DFT methods derive from the 1964 Hohenberg and Kohn theorems,136 stating that all the ground-state properties of an Nelectron system are uniquely determined by the total electron density. In the later Kohn−Sham DFT formulation (by far the most used among those existing), the total energy of the ground state is expressed as a sum of exact terms, and an important (although small) contribution to the energy is given by the exchange-correlation term EXC: E [ ] = T [ ] + J [ ] + V [ ] + EXC [ ] (13) where T is the noninteracting electron kinetic energy, J the Coulomb energy, and V is the energy due to the external feld generated by the nuclei. The frst three terms can be computed exactly, while the exact EXC functional form is not yet known except that for a uniform electron gas, and only approximate forms can be used. An increasing number of functionals, each one with its strength and limitations and difering in the way they approximate the exact XC term, is available in the most common quantum mechanics codes. The simplest approximation of the XC term is the local density approximation137 (LDA) and its generalization including electron spin LSDA (local spin density approximation). The energy is typically separated to an exchange and in a correlation part: E XC = E X + E C (14) While LDA has been widely used for studying bulk properties in solid state physics, it is not appropriate to study surfaces or molecules, since it overestimates the bond energies and produces too short bond lengths. A more sophisticated approximation emerged in the 1980s, making use of both the spin densities and of their gradients (GGA, generalized gradient approximation); typically, but not necessarily, the exchange and correlation terms are separated. The two main approaches to GGA make use of parameters obtained either by a ftting to some data sets, as in the B86 Becke approach,138 or derived using theoretical conditions, as in the Perdew and co-workers approach. 139,140 The development of these functionals was fundamental for DFT to enter into chemistry. A broadly used variant of the GGA, largely applied to the study of the structure and properties of CDs, is constituted by the hybrid-GGA methods, which typically combine the HF exchange integrals with a GGA exchange functional. These types of functionals are commonly referred as “global hybrids” since they are applied on the whole spatial domain without any truncation in short- and long-range domains as in the case of range-separated (RS) hybrids. The popular B3LYP, developed by Stephens and co-workers,141 is an example of global hybrid functional, and it was derived from the three-parameter hybrid GGA functional B3PW91,142 obtained in 1993 by Becke, by replacing in the PW91143 the correlation terms with the LYP GGA. There is a large and increasing number of hybrid functionals, and Gaussian144,145 popular quantum and NWChemmechanical ,146 allow software one to packageschoose among , like dozens of them or even to tune them through a fexible combination of their HF and GGA components. The most used functionals in chemistry and material science are those based on the B3LYP and PBE functionals,147 respectively.However, there are several limitations in using these functionals, such as the reproduction of dispersion forces and the incorrect behavior of the XC functional at long-range, which have relevant impact on the charge-transfer excitation. A promising approach is represented by the RS hybrids functionals in which, diferently from the above-described functionals, the XC functional is divided into short-range and long-range contributions. 148,149 The popular CAM-B3LYP and ωB97XD belong to this class. Another DFT related approach which has been recently improved is the so-called multireference confguration interaction (DFT/MRCI) method. 150,151 In this approach, the total electronic correlation is described by properly adding to the truncated multireference

The CDots were collected by centrifuging the red solution at 10 000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was added into the mixed solvents of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate to remove unreacted molecules and then the solid was dried at 70 °C overnight

From Figure 1B it can be seen clearly that there exists a magic transition region at CA/urea = 0.3–0.4, where the maximum emissions of CDots has been dramatically shifted to red. This indicates that the high molar ratio of CA/urea leads to the red shift of CDots emission because of high extent of carbonization in the materials.

When the reaction temperature is 140 °C, the maximum emission peaks change from blue (≈425 nm) at low molar ratio of CA/urea to green (≈530 nm) at high molar ratio of CA/urea. When the reaction temperature is increased to 160 °C and above, the CDots display green emission (≈540 nm) at low molar ratios of CA/urea. It is further shifted to red emission (≈600 nm) when the molar ratio of CA/urea is higher than 0.3.Furthermore, the maximum emission peak can be shifted to red spectrum region (≈630 nm) when the reaction temperature is set at 200 °C and the molar ratio of CA/urea is larger than 0.7. As it is known, higher temperature will promote the graphitization of CA

spectra of B-CDots (D), G-CDots (E), and R-CDots (F).words, R-CDots possess larger effective conjugation length than B- and G-CDots. Figure 2E shows typical Raman spectra of the three CDots. It exhibits two peaks at 1354 and 1581 cm−1 that correspond to the disordered (D band) and graphite (G band) of carbon materials. As it is known, the ratio of ID/IG is characteristic of the extents of graphite and the ratio of sp3/sp2 carbon. The ratio of ID/IG is 1.16, 0.97, and 0.89 for B-CDots, G-CDots, and R-CDots, respectively. The decrease ratio value implies the increasing graphite content in the CDots from B-, G- to R-CDots, indicating that the graphitization of CDots is enhanced in red emissive CDots which was prepared at the higher molar ratios of CA/urea and higher reaction temperature. To further understand the role of functional groups, various spectroscopy characterizations were employed to investigate the structure of CDots. Figure S2 of the Supporting Information shows the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of CDots. The stretching vibration for OH (3436 cm−1), NH (3190 cm−1), CH2 (2934 cm−1), CC (1617 cm−1), CN (1662 cm−1), and CO (1727 cm−1) indicate the presence of conjugated aromatic structure together with O- and N-containing groups. To investigate the composition and valance state of CDots, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to characterize the surface group of the three typical CDots. Figure S3 of the Supporting Information shows the full survey of XPS of all three CDots, which are composed of C, O, and N elements. The ratio of N to C changes from 0.436, 0.369 to 0.330, respectively, indicating the increasing of carbon content. The O to C ratio increases from 0.165, 0.291 to 0.378 for B-CD, G-CDots, and R-CDots, respectively, indicating the increase of oxygen content. Figure 3D–F illustrates the high resolution C1s XPS spectra of all three CDots. The C1s spectra can be ftted into 4 kinds of C species sp2 C (CC/CC) at 284.4 eV, sp3 C (CO and CN) at 285.7 eV, CO at 287.9 eV and COOH at 290.1 eV.

Correlation Exploratory data analysis in many modeling projects (whether in data science or in research) involves examining correlation among predictors, and between predictors and a target variable. Variables X and Y (each with measured data) are said to be posi‐ tively correlated if high values of X go with high values of Y, and low values of X go with low values of Y. If high values of X go with low values of Y, and vice-versa, the variables are negatively correlated.

Statisticians have long ago proposed other types of correlation coefficients, such as Spearman’s rho or Kendall’s tau. These are correlation coefficients based on the rank of the data. Since they work with ranks rather than values, these estimates are robust to outliers and can handle certain types of non-linearities. However, data scientists can generally stick to Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and its robust alternatives, for exploratory analysis. The appeal of rank-based estimates is mostly for smaller data sets, and specific hyphothesis tests

One easy and effective way to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic, or of model parameters, is to draw additional samples, with replacement, from the sample itself, and recalculate the statistic or model for each resample. This procedure is called the bootstrap, and it does not necessarily involve any assumptions about the data, or the sample statistic, being normally-distributed.

There is a natural human aversion to uncertainty - people (especially experts) say “I don’t know” far too rarely. Analysts and managers, while acknowledging uncertainty, nonetheless place undue faith in an estimate when presented as a single number (a point estimate). Presenting an estimate not as a single number but as a range is one way to counteract this tendency. Confidence intervals do this in a manner grounded in statistical sampling principles

Confidence intervals always come with a coverage level, expressed as a (high) per‐ centage, say 90% or 95%. One way to think of a 90% confidence interval is as follows: it is the interval that encloses the central 90% of the bootstrap sampling distribution of a sample statistic (see “The bootstrap” on page 67). More generally, an x% confi‐ dence interval around a sample estimate should, on average, contain similar sample estimates x% of the time (when a similar sampling procedure is followed)

Of course, what we are really interested in when we have a sample result is “what is the probability that the true value lies within a cer‐ tain interval?” This is not really the question that a confidence interval answers, but it ends up being how most people interpret the answer. The probability question associated with a confidence interval starts out with the phrase “Given a sampling procedure and a pop‐ ulation, what is the probability that…” To go in the opposite direc‐ tion, “Given a sample result, what is the probability that (something is true about the population),” involves more complex calculations and deeper imponderables

The percentage associated with the confidence interval is termed the level of conf‐ dence. The higher the level of confidence, the wider the interval. Also, the smaller the sample, the wider the interval (i.e. the more uncertainty). Both make sense: the more confident you want to be, and the less data you have, the wider you must make the confidence interval to be sufficiently assured of capturing the true value.

While the normal distribution is often appropriate and useful with respect to the dis‐ tribution of errors and sample statistics, it typically does not characterize the distribu‐ tion of raw data. Sometimes, the distribution is highly skewed (asymmetric), such as with income data, or the distribution can be discrete, as with binomial data. Both symmetric and asymmetric distributions may have long tail(s). The tails of a distribu‐ tion correspond to the extreme values (small and large)

There is much statistical literature about the task of fitting statisti‐ cal distributions to observed data. Beware an excessively datacentric approach to this job, which is as much art as science. Data are variable, and often consistent, on their face, with more than one shape and type of distribution. It is typically the case that domain and statistical knowledge must be brought to bear to determine what type of distribution is appropriate to model a given situation. For example, we might have data on the level of internet traffic on a server over many consecutive 5-second periods. It is useful to know that the best distribution to model “events per time period” is the Poisson (see “Poisson Distributions” on page 85).

Gossett wanted to answer the question “what is the sampling distribution of the mean of a sample, drawn from a larger population.” He started out with a resampling experiment - drawing random samples of four from a dataset of 3000 measurements of criminals’ height and left middle finger lengths. (This being the era of eugenics, there was much interest in data on criminals, and in discovering correlations between criminal tendencies and physical or psychological attributes.) He plotted the standar‐ dized results (the z-scores) on the x-axis, and the frequency on the y-axis. Separately, he had derived a function - now known as Student’s t, and he fit this function over the sample results, plotting the comparison (see Figure 2-13).

It is conventional in statistics to term the “1” out‐ come the success outcome; it is also common practice to assign “1” to the more rare outcome. Use of the term “success” does not imply that the outcome is desirable or beneficial; it does tend to indicate the outcome of interest.

This code will generate 100 random numbers from a Poisson distribution with λ= 2. For example, if incoming customer service calls average two per minute, this code will simulate 100 minutes, returning the number of calls in each of those 100 minutes. Exponential distribution Using the same parameter λthat we used in the Poisson distribution, we can also model the distribution of the time between events: time between visits to a web site or between cars arriving at a toll plaza. It is also used in engineering to model time to failure, and in process management to model, for example, the time required per ser‐ vice call. The R code to generate random numbers from an exponential distribution takes two arguments, n (the quantity of numbers to be generated), and rate, the num‐ ber of events per time period. For example: rexp(n = 100, rate = .2) This code would generate 100 random numbers from an exponential distribution where the mean number of events per time period is 2. So you could use it to simulate 100 intervals, in minutes, between service calls, where the average rate of incoming calls is 0.2 per minute. A key assumption in any simulation study for either the Poisson or exponential distri‐ bution is that the rate, λ, remains constant over the period being considered. This is rarely reasonable in a global sense; for example, traffic on roads or data networks varies by time of day, and day of week. However, the time periods, or areas of space, can usually be divided into segments that are sufficiently homogeneous so that analy‐ sis or simulation within those periods is valid. Inference In many applications, the event rate, λ, is known or can be estimated from prior data. However, for rare events, this is not necessarily so. Aircraft engine failure, for exam‐ ple, is sufficiently rare (thankfully) that, for a given engine type, there may be little data on which to base an estimate of time between failures. With no data at all, there is little basis on which to estimate an event rate. However, you can make some guess - if no events have been seen after 20 hours, you can be pretty sure that the rate is not 1 per hour. Via simulation, or direct calculation of probabilities, you can assess differ‐ ent hypothetical event rates and estimate threshold values below which the rate is very unlikely to fall. If there is some data but not enough to provide a precise, reliable estimate of the rate, a goodness-of-fit test (see ???) can be applied to various rates to determine how well they fit the observed data. 86 | Chapter 2: Data and Sampling Distributions

The R code to generate random numbers from an exponential distribution takes two arguments, n (the quantity of numbers to be generated), and rate, the num‐ ber of events per time period. For example:

rexp(n = 100, rate = .2) This code would generate 100 random numbers from an exponential distribution where the mean number of events per time period is 2. So you could use it to simulate 100 intervals, in minutes, between service calls, where the average rate of incoming calls is 0.2 per minute.

key assumption in any simulation study for either the Poisson or exponential distri‐ bution is that the rate, λ, remains constant over the period being considered. This is rarely reasonable in a global sense; for example, traffic on roads or data networks varies by time of day, and day of week. However, the time periods, or areas of space, can usually be divided into segments that are sufficiently homogeneous so that analy‐ sis or simulation within those periods is valid.

This is likely to be the case in mechanical failure - the risk of failure increases as time goes by. The Weibull distribution is an extension of the exponential distribution,

The Weibull distribution is an extension of the exponential distribution, in which the event rate is allowed to change, as specified by a shape paramenter, β. If βis > 1, the probability of an event increases over time, if βis < 1, it decreases

Because the Wei‐ bull distribution is used with time-to-failure analysis, instead of event rate, the second parameter is expressed in terms of characteristic life, rather than in terms of the rate of events per interval. The symbol used is η, the Greek letter eta. It is also called the scale parameter

For events that occur at a constant rate, the number of events per unit of time or space can be modeled as a Poisson distribution 2. In this scenario, you can also model the time or distance between one event and the next as an exponential distribution 3. A changing event rate over time (e.g. an increasing probability of device failure) can be modeled with the Weibull distribution
