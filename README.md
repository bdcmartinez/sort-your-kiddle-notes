# Sort Your Kindle Notes

This program helps you organize the notes you take with your Kindle device. Whether you make notes on PDFs or books, this tool allows you to separate those individual notes into different text files, each named after the book or file you were reading. This makes it easy to export your notes to other platforms like Notion or for any other purpose.

## How It Works

- The program processes a file named `My Clippings.txt`, which is generated by your Kindle.
- It sorts your notes and exports them into separate text files, each named after the corresponding book or document.
- Each note file includes the title of the book/file and the date when the note was taken.

## Usage

1. Ensure the file `My Clippings.txt` is in the same directory as this program.
2. Run the program to generate your sorted notes in individual text files.
3. Use the exported text files as needed, whether it's for Notion, archiving, or other purposes.
